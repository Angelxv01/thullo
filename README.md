## Overview

![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16707738/92399059-5716eb00-f132-11ea-8b14-bcacdc8ec97b.png)

At the moment the demo is not available.

This is the first time I build a complex application like this and I got to admit, I struggled a lot. 
The main goal was to learn as much as possible: I experiment a lot. This means I had to find my way out, there's not a *wrong* way of doing but the only way I found. 

There are obviously anti-pattern, inconsistencies and **a lot** bad practices. This is due to my limited experience, and this is the point. I've learned it's ok to be bad, so there's room for improvement.

I've learned how to communicate effectively to myself and potentially to others, creating a *project agenda(?)* where I fix my goals and **try** to achieve them, find solution to problems which doesn't mean I find the best, but one of them. I've learned decision making which **sometimes** lead me to rewrite everything. I've learned not to overengineering and keep the stuff simple and just do my project... the time to refactor is not at the begininning. This means also I had to prioritize my goals and going against my ego.

> What you've learned and seen during your experience should push you out of your limits.
> Sometimes, this means you'll have to **fail several** times.

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wP0LbGgEeKhpFHUpPpDh) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

Login to the application and and get started with your ideas! You can "easily" (UX and accessibility not considered at the moment) jump in and create and organize you're ideas: create a board, add lists and put some ideas on the board!

Add friends to the board, play with them, add bright and colorful images to your ideas, tag your ideas and comment on your friends'.
